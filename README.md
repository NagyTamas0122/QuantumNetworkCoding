# QuantumCommunication

This is the repository for the simulation of Quantum Network Coding in Python Qiskit.

This is for my independent laboratory theme: Satellite-based Quantum Communication.

QNC is modelled in a Quantum Repeater Network environment.

All modells are based on scientific papers.
